## Conclusions

This project was made by two people during a few weeks as part of a school project. We wanted to create a typical social media clone as we thought it was interesting and useful to develop our skills, but still introduce original elements that best suited our goals - to facilitate a channel that helps the students of our university interact and communicate programming problems.
